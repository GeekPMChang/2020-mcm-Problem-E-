# 2020-mcm-Problem-E-
2020 MCM was really a surprising and unforgettable experience.
We had never try any math model problem on environment.
But this time we try our best and solve the globel plastics problem.
I'm not sure whether it's great or not.
But I know that our project has no possiablity to be a perfect medel.
So if you have any advise,just speak aloud and make modification to the project.
Thanks for reading!
